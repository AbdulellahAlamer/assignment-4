# 🌟 Personal Portfolio Website

## 📘 Project Description

This is a **personal portfolio website** that shows my skills, experience, and favorite projects with a clean design and smooth user experience.  
It has a special **“My Favorite Books”** section that gets data from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).

The website is made with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and includes:

- Smooth **scroll-triggered animations** for sections.
- A **typing effect** for section titles.
- A responsive, modern design with **dark mode**.
- **Error handling** and a **retry button** if the API fails.
